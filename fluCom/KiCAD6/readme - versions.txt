The tried and tested version is TSSOP. At the time of designing the board the TSX0104 level shifters were only available in this package.

As the SOIC package became available again, a version of the board has been adapted (as these are much easier to solder). 
However, this version has not been built or tested by me yet. It passes DRC, that's all I can say at the moment. Build at your own risk.
